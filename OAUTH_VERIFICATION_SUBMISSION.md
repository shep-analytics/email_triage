## Next Steps: Submit for Verification

### Step 1: Open Verification Center
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=inboximp-email-triage

### Step 2: Fill Out OAuth Consent Screen

Make sure all fields are filled:

**App Information:**
- App name: `Inboximp Email Triage`
- User support email: `support@inboximp.com`
- App logo: Upload `/static/inboximp.png` (already in repo)

**App Domain:**
- Application home page: `https://inboximp.com`
- Application privacy policy: `https://inboximp.com/static/privacy.html`
- Application terms of service: `https://inboximp.com/static/terms.html`

**Authorized domains:**
- `inboximp.com`

**Developer Contact:**
- Developer contact info: `support@inboximp.com`

### Step 3: Verify Scopes Are Configured

Ensure these scopes are added (you already have them):
- ‚úÖ `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
- ‚úÖ `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
- ‚úÖ `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.metadata`

### Step 4: Submit Verification Request

Click "Submit for verification" and provide:

#### **Scope Justifications:**

**gmail.modify:**
```
Our app needs to apply labels to Gmail messages to organize the user's inbox.
After classifying emails using AI, we apply labels like "should_read",
"can_delete", or "requires_response" to help users triage their inbox.
This requires the gmail.modify scope to update message labels.
```

**gmail.readonly:**
```
Our app needs to read the full content of email messages to perform AI-powered
classification. We analyze the subject, sender, and body text to determine the
appropriate category and action for each email. The gmail.readonly scope is
required to access full message content (the gmail.metadata scope only provides
headers, not body content which is essential for accurate classification).
```

**gmail.metadata:**
```
Our app uses metadata (headers, labels, dates) to efficiently list and track
which messages have been processed, and to avoid re-processing the same emails.
This allows us to provide a better user experience with faster inbox scanning
and accurate processing history.
```

#### **How Your App Uses Gmail Data:**

```
1. User authorizes the app via OAuth to access their Gmail account
2. App reads incoming emails from the user's inbox
3. Email content (subject, sender, body) is analyzed using AI (OpenRouter API)
   to determine appropriate classification
4. AI determines which label to apply based on email importance and content
5. App applies the determined label to the Gmail message
6. Classification decision is stored in our database for user reference and
   improving accuracy
7. Email content itself is NOT stored permanently - only processed in memory
   during classification

Users can:
- View their classification history in the web console
- Delete their data at any time
- Revoke access via Google Account settings
```

#### **What User Data You Store:**

```
We store:
- Gmail message IDs (to track which emails we've processed)
- Classification decisions (which label was applied and why)
- AI-generated summaries of emails
- OAuth tokens (encrypted, to maintain authorized access)
- User's Gmail email address

We do NOT store:
- Full email content (only processed temporarily in memory)
- Email attachments
- Contact lists
- Unprocessed email bodies
```
